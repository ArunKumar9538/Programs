1. Micro and Array Update
Micro purchased an array A having N integer values. After playing it for a while, he got bored of it and decided to update value of its element. In one second he can increase value of each array element by 1. He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K. Please help Micro to find out the minimum amount of time it will take, for him to do so.

2. Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
Students have become secret admirers of SEGP. They find the course exciting and the professors amusing. After a superb Mid Semester examination, itâ€™s now time for the results. The TAs have released the marks of students in the form of an array, where arr[i] represents the marks of the ith student.
Since you are a curious kid, you want to find all the marks that are not smaller than those on its right side in the array.

5. Hacker and traffic lights
Zolo is stuck in a traffic due to dysfunctional traffic light. Zolo is a professional hacker and he can get into the system and change the state of the light. His planet has different types of traffic lights such that there are N bulbs on the traffic board and only when all of them are green(G) the cars can pass. there are 2 other states also which the bulb can show; i.e. Red(R) & Yellow(Y). Note that the lights are designed such that they follow a state change cyclic pattern as follows:
R------>Y------>G------->R
Once Zolo gets into the system he can select any position i and update all elements between i to min(N, i + K - 1) by increasing their state by 1.This whole process takes 1 sec and he can repeat this process any no. of times until he gets all lights = G . Find the minimum time to do the process as Zolo is getting late for work.
